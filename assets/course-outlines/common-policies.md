- Option 4: Office hours from 12:30H to 13:00H in the office (location to be determined).

## Schoology
This powerful portal is where you will find all the course materials: PPTs, notes, review packages, etc., as well as your grades.

## Course Materials
- A textbook will be issued as a reference.
- Tests and quizzes are to be done on paper or schoology only.
- A digital formula sheet will be given at the beginning of the year. This can be used for tests.

## Class Rules and Expectations

### Respect and Attitude
Treat the teacher, your classmates, and most importantly yourself with respect. Believe in yourself and all of your potential and capabilities. You have what it takes to succeed! Come to class with a positive attitude and do your best. The general aim of this course is to build a community of young scientists who are ready and willing to learn as well as help each other succeed.

### Late/Attendance
Students are expected to attend all classes, be punctual and come prepared. If a student is going to be absent (drivers license, visa, etc.), please notify the teacher in advance to help with scheduling. Unexcused absences lead to frustrations when it comes to testing and this is unfair to other students. Multiple absences will result in a talk to the homeroom teacher.

### Deadlines
All assignments, labs, projects, etc. are due at the start of the class on which they are due.

### Washrooms
It is expected that you will use the washroom before or after class. If you need to use it during class, then do so in a way that does not disrupt the lesson.

### Make-Up Tests
These will be allowed in special circumstances at the judgment of the teacher for quizzes and period tests. Unit tests will not be included in this policy for the following reasons:

1. Unit tests are always given a week notice or more. Quizzes and period tests usually 2-3 days notice. This teacher does not believe in surprise quizzes. If several students cannot be in class on a proposed unit test, then it can be rescheduled to the best possible day.
2. Unfortunately, a make-up test policy is prone to abuse. It is not fair to those students who consistently attend classes and write scheduled tests when others who frequently make up tests get an advantage.

## Academic Integrity

### Cheating and Generative AI use
The Nanmo BC Academic Honesty Policy (found under our Course Admin folder on Schoology) serves as our primary academic integrity framework and supersedes all other policies. In addition to this policy, the following specific procedures and guidelines will be implemented:

1. In cases of suspected cheating, while we maintain the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty' students may be asked to demonstrate their understanding by answering similar questions to verify their knowledge. Inability to demonstrate understanding will result in a mark of zero.
2. Assisting others in cheating will also result in a mark of zero.
3. Repeat offenses will be referred to the principal.
4. Regarding Generative AI (like ChatGPT and others): While these are valuable academic tools for concept explanation and understanding, they can also provide inaccurate information. Submitting AI-generated work as your own violates our Academic Honesty Policy. Use these tools cautiously and responsibly.

### Sleeping
It is considered a good habit to get sufficient sleep every night. Part of that means limiting the use of devices and avoiding video games. It also means good planning and time management to deal with coursework timely and not stay up late. Class time is not a chance to make up lost sleep. For those students who repeatedly try and sleep in class, we will discuss this with the homeroom teacher to find solutions.

### Re-submission and Late-submission Policy
1. Students are permitted to resubmit one assessment that received a grade under 60% one time each semester [Deadlines 12.1 and 6.1]. The highest possible grade achievable on a resubmitted assignment is capped at 75%, to maintain fairness and uphold academic standards, while still providing a chance for improvement.
2. Late submissions will assigned as "missing" and graded zero unless an extension is discussed with the instructor before the original due date.
3. All student submissions must be a single PDF or PPT file, otherwise they will receive a grade of zero.

## Communication Guidelines

### Messaging Procedures for Schoology
Your subject line must include:
{Course Name} - {Section Number} - {Block}
Example: "Physics 11 - Section 2 - Block C"

For Course Content Questions:
1. State the specific unit, lab, or homework assignment
   - Example: "Homework Check Unit 2"
2. Include relevant dates
   - Example: Due dates
3. State your specific question or concern clearly

### Communication Best Practices
Do:
- Include your work/calculations when asking about problems
- Use proper terminology and units
- Attach clear photos of your work when relevant
- Check your manual and course materials first
- Review the worked examples in your notes before asking homework questions

Don't:
- Send messages asking only for answers without showing your work
- Wait until the night before a report is due to ask questions
- Use informal language when discussing concepts
- Skip including units in your questions about calculations

### Response Expectations
- Messages sent during school days will receive a response within 24 hours
- Weekend messages will be answered on the next school day
- For urgent concerns, speak with your teacher in person
- Questions sent the night before tests or due dates may not receive responses in time

## Electronic Device Use Policy
We will adhere to the Nanmo BC Electronic Device Use Policy found under our Course Admin folder on Schoology.

### Classroom Cell Phone Policy
All cell phones must either be placed in the designated phone box or stored in student lockers during class time. No phones are permitted to remain with students during class unless explicitly approved by the teacher.

### Phone Box Procedure
1. Upon entering class, students who have their phones with them must:
   - Place their phone in the designated phone box
   - Ensure their phone is powered off or on silent
2. If a student does not place their phone in the box:
   - It is assumed their phone is stored in their locker
   - No phones may remain in bags, pockets, or desks

### Phone Usage
- Phones may only be retrieved from the box with explicit teacher approval
- Students must state their reason for needing phone access
- Phones must be returned to the box immediately after approved use
- Emergency calls should be directed through the school office

### Honor System Guidelines
- Students are trusted to follow this policy honestly
- No individual phone checks will be conducted
- Students are expected to demonstrate integrity by:
  - Either placing phones in the box or leaving them in lockers
  - Not accessing phones without permission
  - Being truthful about phone possession and usage

### Consequences
If a student is found using or possessing a phone during class without approval:
1. The phone will be confiscated
2. School disciplinary policy regarding unauthorized phone use will be followed
