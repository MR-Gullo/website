# Computer Science 12

## Course Description
This course covers fundamental programming concepts using C++, including syntax, data types, control structures, functions, arrays, strings, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation. Students will develop problem-solving skills through hands-on coding exercises, projects, and a final project. The curriculum also incorporates computer science theory, algorithm design, and relevant topics like digital security and software choices.

## Computer Science Topics
1. Basic Syntax and semantics of a higher-level language (C++)
2. Constants, variables, and literal values for primitive data types
   - Including variable scope
3. Expressions and assignments
   - Including logical statements
4. Simple input and output, including file input/output
5. Functions and parameters
6. Conditional and iterative control structures
7. Recursion
   - We will cover this topic mathematically as well as through writing code
8. Documentation and program style
9. Top-down program design and incremental development
10. Enumerated types
11. Arrays (One and two dimensional)
12. Strings and string processing
13. Sorting and Searching
14. Introduction to Web Development
15. Structs
16. Pointers
17. Dynamic Memory Allocation and Release

## Computer Science Adjacent Topics
Throughout the year we will be incorporating various smaller topics into our studies. Some examples may be:
1. Computer science contest questions (for example Waterloo)
2. Digital security, passwords, etc.
3. Representing images and graphics
4. Software choices
5. Etc.

## Programming Environment
For this course we will be using the C++ integrated development environment (IDE) DevC++. This is available for Windows computers only and can be found at: https://www.bloodshed.net/. This software is already installed on the school computers.

If you are working on a Mac there are several alternatives, and we can work together to find one that will work.

## Assessment Structure
Unlike the standard grading structure, Computer Science 12 uses the following assessment weightings:

| Assessment Type | Weighting |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Exercises | 35% |
| Projects | 25% |
| Tests | 25% |
| Final Project | 15% |

### Pre-lab Questions
For some labs I will post selected multiple-choice questions on Schoology that you should complete before starting the lab. These questions are meant to act as a checkpoint so that you don't waste too much time struggling on the lab.

### Labs
Labs will consist of a handful of small programming exercises that you will complete on a regular basis. I will grade these in one of the following ways (chosen at random, but you won't know until after I have graded them): completion, simple testing, thorough testing. My intention for labs is that they shouldn't take more than an hour or two and you should have lots of class time to complete them.

### Projects
Projects will be given in one of three different forms:
1. A collection of programming exercises that you should complete and test
2. Solving a more complicated, novel problem where you will submit your design, programming, and testing of a program/product
3. Creating a report or presentation for a given topic

### Final Project
Your final project will be like number 2 above but will be much larger in scope.

## CS-Specific Communication Guidelines

### For Project-Related Questions
1. Specify the project name and development phase
2. Include your team number (if applicable)
3. Detail your specific question about: 
   - Project requirements
   - Code implementation
   - Testing
   - Documentation
   - Debugging

### Communication Best Practices for Computer Science
Do:
1. Include your code snippets when asking about problems
2. Use proper programming terminology and syntax
3. Share error messages or stack traces when relevant
4. Check the documentation and course materials first
5. Review the example code in your notes before asking programming questions

Don't:
1. Send messages asking only for solutions without showing your code attempts
2. Wait until the night before a project deadline to ask questions
3. Use informal language when discussing programming concepts
4. Skip including error messages in your debugging questions

### For IDE or Development Environment Issues
1. Specify which IDE/environment you're using
2. Include screenshots of any error messages
3. List the steps that led to the problem
4. Note which OS/version you're using

### When Asking About Code
1. State the programming concept you're working with
2. Show your code, including: 
   - The full code context 
   - Class/function definitions
   - Input values 
   - Expected output 
   - Actual output/errors 
   - Steps you've taken to debug
3. Indicate where you think the logic error might be
