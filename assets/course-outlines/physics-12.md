# Physics 12

## Course Description
This is an introductory course on physics that further explores the basics of motion, forces, energy, fields, electricity, and optics. Students will continue to build a foundation on scientific skills necessarily for the study of physics. The course then focuses on the topics above with applications to real life. The course is designed to prepare students for university physics.

## Topics Covered

## Physics-Specific Communication Guidelines

### Lab-Related Questions
1. Specify the lab name and date performed
2. Include your lab group number (if applicable)
3. Detail your specific question about:
   - Pre-lab requirements
   - Data collection
   - Analysis
   - Lab report format
   - Calculations

### When Asking About Calculations
1. State the formula you're using
2. Show your work, including:
   - A sketch of the problem
   - A free-body diagram
   - Given values
   - Relevant formulas
   - Unit conversions
   - Steps in your solution
3. Indicate where you think you might be making a mistake

Remember: Physics problems often build upon previous concepts. When asking questions, reference any related topics you've already mastered or are struggling with to help your teacher provide more targeted assistance.

### For Physics Simulation or Lab Software Issues
1. Specify which simulation/software you're using
2. Include screenshots of any error messages
3. List the steps that led to the problem
4. Note which browser/device you're using (for PhET simulations)
