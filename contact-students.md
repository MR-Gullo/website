# Contact Information

## Meet Your Instructor: Mr. Gullo

Mr. Gullo is an experienced STEM educator specializing in Physics and Computer Science. He is a licensed teacher in British Columbia and New Zealand with a background in Physics and Computer Science.


**Current Courses:** 
- Physics 11
- Physics 12 
- Computer Science 12

## How to Get Help

When you have questions or need assistance, please follow these steps in order:

1. **Ask a classmate** - Often your peers can provide quick assistance
2. **Research the internet** - Check reliable sources for information
3. **Schoology messaging** - Follow the messaging guidelines below
4. **Office hours** - Visit during office hours from 12:30-13:00 in the office (location TBD)

## Schoology Messaging Guidelines

All message subject lines MUST include:
```
{Course Name} - {Section Number} - {Block}
```
Example: "Physics 12 - Section 2 - Block C"

### For Course Content Questions

1. State the specific unit, lab, or homework assignment
   - Example: "Homework Check Unit 2" or "Python OOP Assignment Unit 2"
2. Include relevant dates
   - Example: Due dates
3. State your specific question or concern clearly
   - Example: "I'm having trouble with problem #4 in the Projectile Motion homework. I've attempted the problem using v = vâ‚€ + at, but I'm getting an unreasonable answer."

### For Lab/Project Questions

1. Specify the lab/project name and date performed (or development phase)
2. Include your lab group number (if applicable) 
3. Detail your specific question about:
   - Pre-lab requirements
   - Data collection/Code implementation
   - Analysis/Testing
   - Lab report format/Documentation
   - Calculations/Debugging

## Communication Best Practices

### Do:
- Include your work/calculations/code snippets when asking about problems
- Use proper physics/programming terminology and units
- Attach clear photos of your work when relevant
- Check your lab manual and course materials first
- Review worked examples in your notes before asking questions

### Don't:
- Send messages asking only for answers without showing your work/code
- Wait until the night before a lab report/project is due to ask questions
- Use informal language when discussing physics/programming concepts
- Skip including units in physics questions or error messages in code questions

## Response Expectations

- Messages sent during school days will receive a response within 24 hours
- Weekend messages will be answered on the next school day
- For urgent lab safety concerns, speak with your teacher in person
- Questions sent the night before tests or due dates may not receive responses in time

## When Asking About Calculations/Code

1. State the formula/programming concept you're using
2. Show your work, including:
   - A sketch of the problem/full code context
   - A free-body diagram/class function definitions
   - Given values/input values
   - Relevant formulas/expected output
   - Unit conversions/actual output or errors
   - Steps in your solution/debugging steps
3. Indicate where you think you might be making a mistake

Remember: Physics and programming concepts build upon previous topics. When asking questions, reference any related topics you've already mastered or are struggling with to help your teacher provide more targeted assistance.
