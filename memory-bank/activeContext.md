# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Initializing the memory bank and setting up the basic project structure for Mr. Gullo's teacher website.

## Recent Changes
- Created `projectbrief.md` to define the project scope and goals.
- Created `productContext.md` to outline the purpose, problems solved, and user experience goals of the website.

## Next Steps
- Set up the basic directory structure for the website.
- Add sample content (e.g., Physics 12 Unit 5 formula sheet, C++ reference sheets).
- Configure Jekyll and deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Technology Stack:** Using GitHub Pages with Jekyll for static site generation.
- **Styling:** Implementing a minimalist, dark theme inspired by Obsidian using custom CSS.
- **Content Format:** Using Markdown for easy editing and GitHub Pages compatibility.
