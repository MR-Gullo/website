# Progress

## What Works
- Initialized the memory bank with core files:
    - `projectbrief.md`
    - `productContext.md`
    - `activeContext.md`
    - `systemPatterns.md`
    - `techContext.md`

## What's Left to Build
- Set up the basic directory structure for the website.
- Add sample content (e.g., Physics 12 Unit 5 formula sheet, C++ reference sheets).
- Configure Jekyll and deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Current Status
The project is in the initial setup phase.

## Known Issues
- None at this time.
