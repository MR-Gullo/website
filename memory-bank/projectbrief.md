# Project Brief: Development of Mr. Gullo's Teacher Website on GitHub Pages

## Project Title
Development of Mr. Gullo's Teacher Website on GitHub Pages

## Background
Mr. Gullo, a physics and computer science teacher at Nanyang Model Private School, requires a professional website to serve as a centralized hub for his students. The site will support his Physics 11, Physics 12, and Computer Science 12 courses by providing easy access to course materials, educational resources, and communication guidelines, enhancing the learning experience and streamlining resource distribution.

## Goals
- Accessibility: Deliver a user-friendly platform for students to access course-related information and resources effortlessly.
- Organization: Structure course materials and educational content logically for efficient student use.
- Professionalism: Reflect Mr. Gullo’s expertise and teaching philosophy through a polished, educator-focused design.
- Ease of Maintenance: Design a website that Mr. Gullo can update and manage with minimal effort over time.

## Target Audience
- Primary: Students in Physics 11, Physics 12, and Computer Science 12 courses.
- Secondary: Prospective students and parents seeking course details.
- Tertiary: Educators interested in accessing shared teaching resources.

## Scope
The website will include the following pages and features, each designed to meet specific educational needs:

### Homepage
- Purpose: Act as the main entry point and overview of the site.
- Content:
    - Welcome message introducing Mr. Gullo and the site’s purpose.
    - Quick navigation links to course pages (Physics 11, Physics 12, Computer Science 12) and resources.
    - Latest updates section (e.g., "March 19, 2025: Updated Physics 12 Unit 5 Formula Sheet").
    - Office hours: Daily 12:30–13:00 (location TBD).
    - Contact link redirecting to the Contact page.

### Course Pages (Physics 11, Physics 12, Computer Science 12)
- Purpose: Provide detailed course-specific information and resources.
- Content Example (Physics 12):
    - Course description: Overview of objectives and topics (e.g., motion, forces, energy, electricity, optics).
    - Units table:
        - Unit
        - Topics
        - Resources
        - Unit 1

        - Formula Sheet (/assets/formulas/physics12/unit1.pdf)
        - Unit 5
        - Circular Motion
        - Formula Sheet (/assets/formulas/physics12/unit5.pdf)
    - Grading breakdown:
        - Component
        - Weight
        - Unit Tests
        - 30%
        - Final
        - 20%
    - Course policies with downloadable outlines (e.g., late submission rules).
    - Links to textbooks, videos, and lab templates.

### Resources Pages
- Purpose: Centralize educational materials across all courses.
- Content:
    - Textbooks and Formula Sheets:
        - Physics 11/12: Links to BC Physics Digital Resources and OpenStax Physics.
        - Computer Science 12: Links to C++ tutorials (e.g., Learn C++).
        - Downloadable formula sheets (e.g., /assets/formulas/physics12/unit5.pdf).
    - Educational Videos:
        - Curated channels (e.g., Khan Academy, The Coding Train).
        - Topic-specific links (e.g., Newton’s Laws, C++ Pointers).
    - Software Resources:
        - Programming tools and tutorials for Computer Science 12 (e.g., DevC++).

### About Page
- Purpose: Showcase Mr. Gullo’s background and teaching approach.
- Content:
    - Professional summary: 5+ years in STEM education, certified in Ontario and BC.
    - Teaching philosophy: Emphasis on inquiry-based learning and practical applications.
    - Education: BSc in Computer Science and Physics (Trent University).
    - Courses taught: Current and past listings.
    - Contact details with office hours reference.

### Contact Page
- Purpose: Outline communication protocols for students.
