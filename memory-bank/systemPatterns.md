# System Patterns

## System Architecture
The website will be a static site generated using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. The architecture follows a simple structure:

- **Pages:** Markdown files containing the content for each page (e.g., homepage, course pages, resources page).
- **Assets:** A directory containing static assets such as CSS files, images, and downloadable resources (e.g., PDFs, reference sheets).
- **Jekyll:** Jekyll will process the Markdown files and assets to generate the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the website.
- **GitHub Pages:** GitHub Pages will host the generated static files, making the website accessible to users.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Static Site Generation:** Using Jekyll for static site generation provides simplicity, security, and performance.
- **Markdown Content:** Using Markdown for content creation allows for easy editing and version control.
- **Custom CSS:** Implementing a custom CSS stylesheet provides a consistent and visually appealing design.

## Design Patterns in Use
- **Modular CSS:** The CSS will be structured in a modular way, with separate files for different components and styles.
- **Responsive Design:** The website will be designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.

## Component Relationships
- **Pages <--> Assets:** Pages link to assets such as images, CSS files, and downloadable resources.
- **Jekyll --> Pages:** Jekyll processes the Markdown files in the Pages directory.
- **Jekyll --> Assets:** Jekyll includes the assets in the generated website.
- **GitHub Pages --> Jekyll Output:** GitHub Pages hosts the static files generated by Jekyll.
